# 🐍 python-projects

## 📃 Description
A collection of python projects from when I started programming, with projects related to web scraping, visualisation, etc.

### 🛍 amazon-scraper
A scraper built using Selenium and BS4, which opens a Firefox tab based on the product to be searched and scrapes all the products available across all pages. All results are then stored in a CSV file.

### 📁 directory-tree-generator
A simple program that uses the absolute path of a directory to construct a tree-like structure of all the directories and files within that specific directory.

### 🎨 image-to-ascii
A simple program that converts an input image into ASCII art based on the shade of the color of a pixel in the image.

### 👨‍🏭 jobs-scraper
A scraper similar to the ```amazon-scraper``` using only BS4 to scrape jobs of indeed.com based on the job entry provided. All results are then stored in a CSV file.

### 🕹 snake-game
Classic snake game built using Pygame. My first ever project.

### 📊 sorting-visualiser
A visualisation program that sorts randomly-generated arrays based on the selected sorting algorithm chosen, with each element in the array having a number which corresponds with it's height on the visualisation. The GUI is built using Pygame.

### ➕ timestable-bot
A simple project that uses a simple script to automatically solve timestable questions on the DrFrost website and make me the god of mental arithmetic.

### 💬 whatsapp-spam-bot
An extremely simple project I made in less than 5 minutes to payback an annoying friend that loved spamming.
